/*
Part 1
Write a class called myArrayLists that includes the following methods:

A method called numbers that creates an arraylist of integers, fills it with random integers between 1 and 20 inclusive and returns it.

A method called search that accepts an arraylist of integers and integer item, then searches for the item in the arraylist if the item is found,  it  returns true, otherwise it returns false.

A method called sort that accepts an arraylist of integers, sort the arraylist in ascending order and returns the sorted arraylist.

A method called swap that accepts an arraylist of integers and two integers indexA and indexB then it swaps elements with idexA and indexB and returns the swapped arrayList.

A method called shuffle that accepts an arraylist of integers, shuffles it  and returns the shuffled arraylist.

A method called reverse that accepts an arraylist of integers, reverses the arraylist and returns it.

A method called insert that accepts an arraylist of strings, an integer index and a string variable name. The method inserts the name in the given position(index) and returns the updated arraylist.

A method called takeOut that accepts an arraylist of strings and integer index, removes the element at the given position(index)  and returns the updated arraylist.

An overloaded takeOut method that accepts an arraylist of string and a string variable name, removes the given name(element)  and returns the updated method.

A method called replace that accepts an arraylist of strings, an integer index,and a string name then replaces the name with the element at the given index and returns the modified arraylist..    

Part B
Create a Tester class that includes a main method.
Create an arraylist of 20 random numbers called list using numbers method.
Create an arraylist of strings called names and fill it with 6 different names of your choice.
Call all above mentioned methods using list and names arraylists.
Print your outputs for each case.
